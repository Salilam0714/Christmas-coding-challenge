      <h2>YINGTONG LIN (SALI)</h2>
      <p class="self-intro">When you see my name, you can tell that I am from China. You can call me Lin or Sali. I've been living in Canada for two years now. Before I came to Canada, I studied marketing and advertising. But I didn't like this field. After a long period of thinking and many attempts, I realized that I want to work in a computer-related field, so I go back to school and now here I am! I'm trying to develop new hobbies as I re-establish my life in Canada. If you'd like to learn more about my hobbies, you can click on the "HOBBIES" button below. I love sleeping and I'm always sleepy, but I try to learn more about computers because I have goals. If you want to know about my goals and future plans, click the "GOALS" button!.</p>
