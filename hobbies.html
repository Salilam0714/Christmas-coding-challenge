    <p class="hobby-intro">Discovering your hobbies is not an easy thing to do. Some people are lucky enough to know what they like from the moment they are born; others are not so lucky and it takes them a long time to find what they love. I'm one of the latter. I'm always trying to find hobbies that make me feel positive or joyful. These are the things I've been doing a lot of lately ......</p>

    <h2>Ukulele</h2>
    <p>I need an instrument to accompany me when I sing. At first I wanted to choose the guitar, but my fingers are too short! So I chose the ukulele hahahah... I'm still a beginner, but when I focus on practicing ukulele makes me feel happy and fulfilled!</p>

    <h2>Chinese Calligraphy</h2>
    <p>I've been practicing Chinese calligraphy recently. I don't do this very well, but when I am writing it, I feel peaceful. It is also a process of connecting with my own culture. The content of my calligraphy is usually some ancient Chinese poems and articles.</p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>I read books sometimes. I read many types of books, such as fiction, history, politics, philosophy, geography, etc. But I'm a slow reader and it usually takes me a long time to finish a book :(</p>

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>I love to travel! I went to some places in 2023! Including Vancouver, Banff, London, Madrid, and Helsinki. I went to Vancouver with my friends and then drove to Banff. I went to England and Spain by myself. And then on the way back to China I stopped in Finland for a while. Then I flew to England again to meet up with friends. It was busy and tiring but fun and hopefully next year I'll have chances to explore more places!</p>
